# Time Series Analysis, Chicken Pox Cases in NYC
The goal of this project is to create a time-series model based on real-life data and predict future data points by means of data forecasting. The project is based on a time-series dataset of the monthly reported number of cases of chickenpox in New York City, from January 1931- June 1972. The motivation for running a time series analysis on this dataset is to gain a greater understanding of any trends/patterns that existed in the chickenpox epidemic from 1931-1972. This analysis holds great value because it gives further insight into predicting potential future spikes in the chickenpox epidemic. In present times where we currently deal with the Covid-19 pandemic, it is especially interesting to conduct research on and analyze the patterns/trends of a past epidemic in order to understand how current and future pandemics may behave over time.
